## 🎯 The Task

The task was to create a Node application that interacts with HubSpot API endpoints. This was a prerequisite for earning the HubSpot Integration I: Foundations certification, alongside passing an examination.

## 📝 My Experience

Throughout this project, I committed to my repository, ensuring that the adjustments and enhancements were documented. The freedom to choose the subject of the custom object allowed me to unleash my creativity.

I set up a HubSpot test account and worked with my app access token.

## 📈 The Learning Curve

This project demanded proficiency in Node, Express, Axios, the Pug templating system, the command line, and Git and GitHub. It was an excellent opportunity to apply and refine these skills.

## 🏆 The Result

In the end, I managed to create at least three new routes in my `index.js` file and two new pug templates, one for the homepage and one for the update page.

I managed to test the app by running `node index.js` in my terminal and opening up the link to the localhost. It worked as expected. I was able to create a new CRM record on the “/update-cobj” route and then saw those changes reflected in the homepage table. This demonstrated the successful integration of the app with the CRM and the ability to manipulate and display data in real-time.

## 💭 Final Thoughts

This practicum was not just a test of understanding the HubSpot Integration I: Foundations course, but also a test of my ability to research and troubleshoot common full-stack development challenges. I am proud of the work I have done and look forward to applying these skills in future projects.
